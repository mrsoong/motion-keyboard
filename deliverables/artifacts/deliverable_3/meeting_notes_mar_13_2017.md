## Meeting Notes - Mar.13.2017 - 8pm-9pm

### TA Advice:

- We should think of a way to set our keyboard as the current keyboard.

- A plished keyboard is better than a okish suite.

- For the project video: we should show our suite of apps in point form. Before we introduce apps in the suite, we should first show the where we are in the point form.

- Setting shot is too long.

- Artifacts should be mentioned in Review.


### Goal for deliverable 3
- Magnify a key when cursor hovers above it.

- Aim by next Wednesday to finish the remote control feature.
