Scene 0: 

A person (with carpal tunnel syndrome) enters the room and attempts to use the 
keyboard on his phone. As he is making gestures with his finger, it becomes clear 
he suffers from pain whenever he makes certain gestures with  his hands. 
He gives up, he does a search on the internet for 'alternate accessible keyboards', 
and the first link is MotionKey. He is curious, and he installs it.

Scene 1: 

Hi, we are group 15. Our product is MotionKey - a keyboard that is entirely controlled 
through sensors in SmartPhones rather than via the touchscreen. This product will 
augment the ability of marginalized groups to better control the user interface.
Whether you are a war veteran who lost his limbs in Iraq or a person who suffers from 
carpal tunnel syndrome and so cannot use a touchscreen without suffering from hand pain,
our product is aimed to improve your user experience. You simply install the product,
and every time the softwar keyboard on android is supposed to appear, our keyboard 
appears instead.

Scene 2: 

Here, we show a demonstration of our product:
We start off by sideloading the app to the phone and then switching the regular
keyboard for motionkey. Then, start up any scenario in android where the software 
keyboard appears. Instead of the regular keyboard, we can now see motionkey appearing 
in its place. The demonstration shows the entire work flow of using your telephone 
elimating having to ever to use the touch keyboard.
All key presses can be registered solely through physical movements of the keyboard 
itself, which opens up a vast number of possibilities for individuals who may not  
physically be capable of using the touchscreen. While our team specifically
is focusing on making the keyboard,  we are abstracting away the job of handling 
touch key presses to another team.

 Scene 4:

 For our backlog we are planning to streamline the user experience of using the 
 keyboard. Keys will be larger and more visually appea0ling - the general feeling 
 of the motion will be smoother and more user friendly. We also plan to make a 'suite'
 of apps that can all enhance the ability of disabled persons to interact with 
 computers. For example, we are planning to allow the android phone to act as a 
 motion controller for windows, so that a disabled person can interact with their 
 pc without ever having to physically interact with the keyboard or mouse.

Finale:

We hope this video inspired your curiosity, both in terms of what physically 
disabled persons have to go through and the
capabilities of modern tech to make their lives easier. Thank you!
