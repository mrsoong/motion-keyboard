Script

Scene 1: 

A person (with carpal tunnel syndrome) enters the room and attempts to use the keyboard on his phone.
As he is making gestures with his finger, it becomes clear he suffers from pain whenever he makes certain gestures with his hands. He gives up, he does a search on the internet for 'alternate accessible keyboards', and the first link is MotionKey. He is curious, and he installs it.

Scene 2:

Hi, we are group 15. Our product is MotionKey - a keyboard that is entirely controlled through sensors in SmartPhones rather
than via the touchscreen. This product will augment the ability of marginalized groups to better control the user interface.
Whether you are a war veteran who lost his limbs in Iraq or a person who suffers from carpal tunnel syndrome and so cannot
use a touchscreen without suffering from hand pain, our product is aimed to improve your user experience. You simply install the product,
and every time the softwar keyboard on android is supposed to appear, our keyboard appears instead.

Here, we show a demonstration of our product:
 *someone starts off by sideloading the app to their phone*
 *then someone switches the regular keyboard to this keyboard*
 *then start up the browser, and click on the search bar, instead of the usual keyboard appearing, this one will apear*
 *then, demonstrate typing www.google.com on the keyboard*
 *then once google starts up again, we enter something into the google search bar*

Scene 3:

 Now, go back to talking:
 As you can see, the entire work flow of using your telephone will eliminate having to ever to use the touch keyboard.
 All key presses can be registered solely through physical movements of the keyboard itself, which opens up a vast number
 of possibilities for individuals who may not have physically be capable of using the touchscreen. While our team specifically
 is focusing on making the keyboard, we are abstracting away the job of how a person can interact with
 the screen for other activities like selection icons to a different team, so that the entire user experience of using 
 a modern smartphone can eliminate touch gestures.

 Scene 4:

 For our backlog we are planning to streamline the user experience of using the keyboard. Keys will be larger and more visually appearling - the general feeling of the motion will be smoother and more user friendly. We also plan to make a 'suite' of apps that can all enhance the ability of disabled persons to interact with computers. For example, we are planning to allow the android phone to act as a motion controller for windows, so that a disabled person can interact with their pc without ever having to physically interact with the keyboard or mouse.

 We hope this video inspired your curiosity, both in terms of what physically disabled persons have to go through and the
 capabilities of modern tech to make their lives easier. Thank you!
