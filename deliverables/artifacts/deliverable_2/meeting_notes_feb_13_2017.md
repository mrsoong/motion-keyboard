### Highlights:
- 5 minute presentation in front of tutorial group
    - questions asked to us:
        - what is your target audience?
        - who are your competitors
        - how is your product different from competitors?
        - what problem does this solve that competitors don't? What is the problem exactly?
        - [student] why are you building in android instead of ios?



### Discussion:
- figure out git branching modeling
- in the Android Development Environment, will the simulator be able to test gyroscope functions?



### Tasks that need to be completed:
- all members must read and get familiar with the Android Development Kit and Documentation
- do the simple keyboard tutorial and learn the basics of android
- assign group roles:
    - group leader
    - android tester
    - ui design
    - android documentation
    - meeting note taker
    - who will merge pull requests (pair members so each merges the other's)



### Things we need to solidify:
- pain points
- target user / core user
- what niche are trying to fill
- don't keep switching between target users (people in noisy environments vs people without hands)
- what makes this product different from competitors



### Before Next Meeting:
- plan things to discuss during meeting beforehand so we don't waste time
- discuss member attendance during meetings



### TA Advice (Substitute TA for Adam):
- find a good issue tracking system to add things that need to be done
    - github issues
    - esena
- never assign one task to two different people. Two people can work on one task, but one person will be responsible for it.
- make mockups with Balsamiq
- another idea could be to use this gyroscope hand eye coordination as a game to train people that are recovering from nerve damage or used as a training exercise for jobs requring extremely good precision. Like those games where you have to move the ring through the metal loops without touching the loop, or like a ball in a maze game.
- think about the specific group of users, need to make the application that fit the users.
