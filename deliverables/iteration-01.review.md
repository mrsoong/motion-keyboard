# MOTIONKEY ANDROID KEYBOARD

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Feb.6.2017
 * Where: BA2165 & Online Via Slack

## Process - Reflection

As this was our last meeting before submitting the first deliverable, the main purpose of it was to finalize our product idea. During the meeting, new ideas came about that were interesting such as a programming IDE with screen reader for the blind, but ultimately the majority voted in favour of going ahead with MotionKey as it seemed like a unique project that was manageable to do.

#### Decisions that turned out well

 [comment]: <> (* 2 - 4 decisions.)
 [comment]: <> ( * Ordered from most to least important.)
 [comment]: <> (* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.)
 [comment]: <> (* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).)
 
- #####Slack - Online Team Messaging
	- We decided to use an online tool called "Slack" for daily communication. This turned out to be a very successful decision because it allowed the entire group to pass information to each other. Some key benifits it provided us with:
		- Continued discussing possible product ideas over the weekend of February 4th, 2017
		- Members were able to inform the group when they were unable to attend meetings
		- Shared meeting summaries with group members who were unable to attend the meeting

- #####More Time To Brainstorm
	- Not settling on an idea too early on gave us time to bounce more ideas off one another and people we know outside of school. Interesting problems and insights with our product came about that led to considering changing the product altogether. Hearing different reasonings to keeping the product vs changing led us to consider pros and cons of the product functionality in much greater depth. Some key benifits it provided us with:
		- Greater familiarity with each team members thinking process
		- Much richer and broader ideas for potential projects
		- We know early on what our product will be good and bad for at a greater level of depth than if we decided on the idea without putting much thought into it.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 [comment]: <> (* 2 - 4 decisions.)

- #####In-Person Meetings
	- In person meetings we scheduled apart from tutorial days were not planned as great as we liked. Although most members did show up and rest were available online through Slack, we were unable to find a good room to hold the meeting in. This led to a shorter meeting conducted in a hallway which wasn't as conductive to the team process.
		- Due to unforeseeable circumstances, group members getting sick, our in-person meetings were not as productive as they could be.
		- Needed to arrange times when most members were able to meet which was difficult to do due to each members scheduling conflicts.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 [comment]: <> (* Ordered from most to least important.)
 [comment]: <> (* Explain why you are making a change.)
 
In the next coming weeks we will create new roles for the team as they come up. Examples of possible roles could be those more managerial in nature, meeting minute taker, meeting leader, etc. Right now we have very minimal roles so with further development we will need to add roles.     

Another change we are planning on making is with regards to Git branch modeling. As of this review we have not reached a consensus as to how to model our branching. Our current thoughts are to split the initial development into three branches: UI, Gyroscope control, and Spell checking.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

[comment]: <> (* 2 - 4 items)
[comment]: <> (* Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
[comment]: <> (* High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.)
[comment]: <> (* These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.)
[comment]: <> (* Can be related to product and/or process.)

 Learning Android development<br>
  As of now the group as a whole has very little experience with android development. In order to proceed the the group needs to spend time learning android development.
   Fortunately all our members have experience with Java, so we can jump in with Android development. [Google Android Training](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html "Google Android Training") is a good place to start.<br>

 Start modifying a basic custom keyboard <br>
 	Experimenting with our custom UI. Using online tutorials such as [this](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-custom-keyboard-on-android--cms-22615 "this") and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nsa7BuoWhU "this")
 	We plan to get a custom keyboard up and running and branch from our basic custom keyboard.

 Decide on a Git Branching model <br>
 	As has been previously discussed we have not reached a consensus on our git branching model. At the end of the next iteration we plan to decide and implement out branching model.
