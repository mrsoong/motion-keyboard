# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.
 >
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.


 [comment]: <> (* 2 - 4 decisions.)
 [comment]: <> ( * Ordered from most to least important.)
 [comment]: <> (* Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.)
 [comment]: <> (* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).)
 
We decided to use a program called "Slack" for daily communication. This turned out to be a very successful decision because it allowed the entire group to pass information to each other. <br>
Reasoning for this can be seen with <br>
- Continued discussing possible product ideas over the weekend of February 4th, 2017
- Members were able to inform the group when they were unable to attend meetings
- Shared meeting summaries with group members who were unable to attend the meeting

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

 [comment]: <> (* 2 - 4 decisions.)
 [comment]: <> (* Ordered from most to least important.)
 [comment]: <> (* Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).)
   
Due to unforeseeable circumstances, group members getting sick, our in-person meetings were not as productive as they could be. 

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 [comment]: <> (* Ordered from most to least important.)
 [comment]: <> (* Explain why you are making a change.)
 
In the next coming weeks we will create new roles for the team as they come up. Examples of possible roles could be those more managerial in nature, meeting minute taker, meeting leader, etc. Right now we have very minimal roles so with further development we will need to add roles.     

Another change we are planning on making is with regards to Git branch modeling. As of this review we have not reached a consensus as to how to model our branching. Our current thoughts are to split the initial development into three branches: UI, Gyroscope control, and Spell checking.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

[comment]: <> (* 2 - 4 items)
[comment]: <> (* Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
[comment]: <> (* High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.)
[comment]: <> (* These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.)
[comment]: <> (* Can be related to product and/or process.)

 Learning Android development<br>
  As of now the group as a whole has very little experience with android development. In order to proceed the the group needs to spend time learning android development.
   Fortunately all our members have experience with Java, so we can jump in with Android development. [Google Android Training](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html "Google Android Training") is a good place to start.<br>

 Start modifying a basic custom keyboard <br>
 	Experimenting with our custom UI. Using online tutorials such as [this](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-custom-keyboard-on-android--cms-22615 "this") and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nsa7BuoWhU "this")
 	We plan to get a custom keyboard up and running and branch from our basic custom keyboard.

 Decide on a Git Branching model <br>
 	As has been previously discussed we have not reached a consensus on our git branching model. At the end of the next iteration we plan to decide and implement out branching model.
