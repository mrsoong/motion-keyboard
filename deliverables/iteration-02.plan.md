#### Events

Describe meetings (and other events) you are planning to have:

 * When and where? In-person or online?
 * What's the purpose of each meeting?
 * Other events could be coding sessions, code reviews, quick weekly sync' meeting online, etc.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to organize your team.       

 * Artifacts can be To-do lists, Task boards, schedule(s), etc.
 * We want to understand:
   * How do you keep track of what needs to get done?
   * How do you prioritize tasks?
   * How do tasks get assigned to team members?

#### Git / GitHub workflow



Our git repository has 3 branches. Master, development, and features.

| Branch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Master | Only that is fully tested, documented. Only the code that we're comfortable with our Professor/TA looking at. |
| Development | Code that is part of the basic MVP, or not fully tested, documented, etc. features |
| Feature | Branch for working on modular features |

The process of working with the repository is 
 * Fork the group repository. 
 * Clone the fork.
 * Make commits on proper branch to the fork repository.
 * Pull request from forked repository to group repository.

A pull request cannot be merged by the person who initiated it.
In order to merge the development branch to the master it must be approved by a minimum of 3 group members, preferably by every member of Team 15.
 
For this milestone we are aiming to work on completing the MVP, as a result we will not fully utilize the feature branch.

We decided to use this workflow for multiple reasons. The master branch ensures that we meet our coding standards.
The development branch allows members to commit code that may not be fully implemented, documented, tested, but still enable other team members who may 
relay on those features to use the latest implementation. The feature branch increases modularity of our design. Modularity is very important to us. It
enables our team to work on multiple features in our backlog simultaneously while avoiding as many merge conflicts as possible.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

 * Describe your goals for this iteration and the tasks that you will have to complete in order to achieve these goals.
 * Order the items from most to least important.
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to specify some/all tasks as user stories.

#### Artifacts

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

 * Artifacts can be text, code, images, videos, interactive mock-ups and/or any other useful artifact you can think of.
 * Make sure to explain the purpose of each artifact (i.e. Why is it on your to-do list? Why is it useful for your team?)
 * Be concise, yet precise.         
   For example: "Build the website" is not precise at all, but "Build a static home page and upload it somewhere, so that it is publicly accessible" is much clearer.
