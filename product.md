#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

The product that we are building is an Android keyboard controlled with the phone's gyroscope. This allows the user to write text by tilting their phone.
This keyboard will function as an alternative for those who have trouble using a keyboard with touch input. It also serves as an alternative to text-to-speech for enviroments where speaking isn't possible.
The keyboard can be used in any Android application that uses a keyboard.

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read)
 * Start with a single sentence, high-level description of the product.
 * Be clear - Describe the problem you are solving in simple terms.
 * Be concrete. For example:
    * What are you planning to build? Is it a website, mobile app,
   browser extension, command-line app, etc.?
    * When describing the problem/need, give concrete examples of common use cases.
 * Focus on *what* your product does, and avoid discussing *how* you're going to implement it.
   For example: This is not the time or the place to talk about which programming language and/or framework you are planning to use.
 * **Feel free (and very much encouraged) to include useful diagrams, mock-ups and/or links**.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

The target group for our product is anyone who, for some reason, cannot use a touch keyboard. This may be due to reasons such as missing limbs, nerve damage or Parkinson's disease.

**TODO: add personas**

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * Be specific (e.g. )
 * Feel free (but not obligated) to use personas.
   You can create your personas as part of this Markdown file, or add a link to an external site (for example, [Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/user-persona/)).

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

Our product would help our target group to become more independent in their everyday use of their mobile phones. Today they might refrain from typing longer texts on their phones due to the difficulty of getting it correct.
They may also use other options, such as text-to-speech, and our product would work as complement to this. While text-to-speech is very developed and efficient today, there are many enviroments where it cannot be used. For example in public or open office spaces.

 * Short (1 - 2 min' read max)
 * We want you to "connect the dots" for us - Why does your product (as described in your answer to Q1) fits the needs of your users (as described in your answer to Q2)?
 * Explain the benefits of your product explicitly & clearly. For example:
    * Save users time (how much?)
    * Allow users to discover new information (which information? And, why couldn't they discover it before?)
    * Provide users with more accurate and/or informative data (what kind of data? Why is it useful to them?)
