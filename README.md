  This motion keyboard was created by a group of students including Steven, Jun Lin, Tanzin, Mansoor and Fredrik (for the first half of the project) in early 2017 at the University of Toronto. Different team members were responsible for developing different parts of the keyboard, and the uploader (Steven) was primarilyl reponsible for some of the basic keyboard functionalities in addition to several other aspects of the project.
  The original repository for this keyboard is private, but in the event that is made public it can always be found here (https://github.com/csc301-winter-2017/project-team-15)
